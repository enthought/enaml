""" A find-replace dialog.

To make the buttons look nice, we set weak constraints requesting that the
adjacent buttons have the same width after satisfying all of the other
constraints. The left border of the Fields should be aligned. The width taken
up by the buttons is controlled by the lower row since the PushButton labels
"Replace" and "Replace & Find" take up more space than "Find" and "Find Next".
The lower row's buttons are not equal widths, because that would take up
a bunch of extra space, but the top row's buttons do expand equally to take up
the available space.
