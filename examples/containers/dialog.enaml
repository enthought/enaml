""" Dialogs

In this example, the MainWindow displays a PushButton prompting you to press
it. It will raise a modal confirmation Dialog asking you if you really want to do
it. Once you select OK or Cancel on the confirmation Dialog, an information
Dialog will be raised to tell you the result of your action.
