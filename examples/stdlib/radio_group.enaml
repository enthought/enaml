""" RadioGroup Example

In this example, we show how to use one of the Enaml standard library
components. The Enaml standard library is a collection of useful 
widgets, which are themselves defined in Enaml.

We create a main window with a SpinBox on the top which controls how
many RadioButtons are created. Below the SpinBox is a ComboBox which
constrols the layout orientation of the RadioGroup. Below the ComboBox 
is the RadioGroup, which contains the number of buttons specified by the 
'how_many' atribute. Whenever a new button in selected, the selection is 
printed to the shell.

"""
from enaml.stdlib.radio_group import RadioGroup


MainWindow(Window):
    how_many = 10
    SpinBox:
        value := how_many
    ComboBox:
        id: switch
        items = ['horizontal', 'vertical']
        value = items[0]
    RadioGroup:
        orientation << switch.value
        selected >> print(selected)
        items << range(how_many)
