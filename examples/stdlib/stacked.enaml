""" Stacked Container

A Stacked Container holds a list of child widgets (themselves usually 
Containers of some sort) and displays only one of them at a time. The 
displayed widget can be changed by through its `index` attribute. Usually, 
this is controlled by some other widget. In this example, a ComboBox 
describing the contents of each child switches between the two child Forms.
