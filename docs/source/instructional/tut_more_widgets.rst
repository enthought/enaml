More on |Enaml| Widgets
===============================================================================

In this tutorial, we take a closer look at some of the widgets available for
building GUI's in |Enaml| by building a "working" progress bar. We'll introduce
some new attributes including the ``id`` tag and two new |Enaml| operators: the
subscription operator ``<<`` and the notification operator ``::`` along with
some component-specific attributes.

Let's start with the code from :download:`progress_bar.enaml
<../../../examples/components/progress_bar.enaml>`:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/components/progress_bar.enaml
    :language: python


We're setting up a view which builds on a top-level ``MainWindow``. The view
has an attribute ``model`` which must be an instance of ``ProgressModel``,
and by default it is initialized to an instance of the class.  The window
has a ``Container`` which itself contains three widgets: a ``ProgressBar``, a
``Label``, and a ``PushButton``. (In the :ref:`tech-ref` you can find a list and
descriptions of widgets and components from the :ref:`built-ins <built-ins-ref>`
and :ref:`standard library <std-library-ref>`.)

The result when you run it looks like:

.. image:: images/progress_bar.png

In this example, we see some things we have not seen before:
    * Python code included in an |Enaml| file.
    * the ProgressBar, Label and PushButton have ``id`` tags.
    * the text attributes of the Label and PushButton both use the subscription
      operator ``<<``
    * the PushButton's ``clicked`` event uses the notification operator ``::``
    * the Container object has a ``constraints`` attribute

Python Code in |Enaml| Files
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The |Enaml| language is a strict superset of Python, so in addition to the
``enamldef`` definitions we have seen, you can define regular Python functions,
classes and even module-level global variables.  Any valid Python code can be
used in this context, in particular, you can also ``import`` any other Python
or Enaml modules that you might like.

The advantage of doing this is that your Python code is available when you run
the |Enaml| file using the ``enaml-run`` command.  You can also access any
Python objects defined inside an .enaml file, as long as that .enaml file is
imported using the ``enaml.import()`` context manager.

For example, you use a different ``ProgressModel`` instance than the default,
you could do the following from within a .py file::

    import enaml
    
    with enaml.import():
        import progress_bar
    
    model = progress_bar.ProgressModel(work_units=100)
    view = progress_bar.Main(model=model)
    view.show()

``id`` Tags
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

|Enaml| uses a special attribute called an ``id`` tag to let you refer to a
component or widget from elsewhere in the declaration. Note that no quotation
marks are necessary. Because of the line ``id: progress`` under
``ProgressBar:`` we can refer to this component as ``progress`` in code blocks
of similar *scope*. (We will have a more detailed discussion of scope later.)
``progress`` has two other attributes whose values we delegate with the ``:=``
operator.

Subscription Operator ``<<``
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **subscription operator** ``<<`` is an |Enaml|-specific operator that makes
the object on the left-hand side depend on the value of the Python-valid
expression on the right-hand side of the operator. If there are variables in
the expression on the right-hand side, then |Enaml| registers dependencies for
each, and when any of the variable objects in the expression changes, the
object on the left-hand side will be recomputed.

::

    text << '{0}% ({1}/{2})'.format(progress.percentage, progress.value, progress.maximum)

The ``text`` attribute of the ``Label`` object in our example is *subscribed*
to a formatted string, with dependencies on ``progress.percentage``,
``progress.value``, and ``progress.maximum``.

Enaml's dependency analysis is quite sophisticated, and will connect
dependencies across multiple attribute lookups, and even into list
comprehensions, if-else expressions and other complex Python constructs.

::

    text << "Do Some Work" if progress.percentage < 100 else "Reset"

The ``work_button`` widget also has a subscribed text attribute; in this case it
is a Python ``if`` statement dependent on the value of ``progress.percentage``.

Notification Operators ``::`` and ``>>``
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **notification operator** ``::`` is different from the other |Enaml|
operators in that it is followed by a block of Python code, rather than a Python
expression.  Whenever the attribute or event on the left-hand side of the
notification operator changes, the block of code will be executed.

::

    clicked :: 
        if progress.percentage < 100:
            model.do_work()
        else:
            model.reset()

In our example, changes to the ``clicked`` attribute of ``work_button`` will
cause the methods ``model.do_work()`` or ``model_reset()`` to be called
depending on the value of ``progress.percentage`` at the time that the change
happens.

It is worth mentioning at this point that there is one remaining |Enaml|
operator, ``>>`` which pushes a value onto another when it changes.  The
right-hand side of this operator must be a simple attribute expression which
will get set with the new value of the left-hand side.

For example, if our model had an object with a ``percentage`` trait, we could
have the ``ProgressBar`` use the ``>>`` operator to update it.

::

    ProgressBar:
        id: progress
        progress >> model.progress

This is a short-hand for the equivalent::

    ProgressBar:
        id: progress
        progress ::
            model.progress = progress

Similarly, the delegation operator ``:=`` as used like this::

    ProgressBar:
        id: progress
        value := model.units_done

is equivalent to::

    ProgressBar:
        id: progress
        value << model.units_done
        value >> model.units_done


Constraints
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the primary motivations for the development of the Enaml toolkit was to
allow greater control over the appearance and layout of user interfaces built
on top of Traits.  Until this point we have been relying on the default layouts
provided by container widgets like ``Container`` and ``Form``, but we have the
option to override these so we can specify layout more precisely.

By default the ``Container`` widget lays out its child widgets in a vertical
stack, with each widget stretched horizontally to the width of the container.
In the progress bar example, we have defined a replacement set of constraints
by setting a value on the ``constraints`` attribute of the Container.

::

    constraints = [
        vbox(progress,
            hbox(spacer, label, spacer), 
            hbox(spacer, work_button, spacer),
            spacer),
        align('h_center', progress, label, work_button),
    ]

This layout is hopfully fairly clear: the children of the container should be
layed out vertically in a box, with the progress bar above the label which is
in turn above the work_button.  At the bottom is a spacer, which provides an
expanding amount of space, meaning that the other items in the vbox will not
expand.  Similarly, the label and work_button are layed out inside horizontal
boxes with spacers on either side, so they will not expand horizontally beyond
their natural width.

Finally we constrain the three widgets so that they are aligned on their
horizontal centers, meaning that the vertical stack of widgets will align to
the center of the container.

The objects ``vbox``, ``hbox``, ``align`` and ``spacer`` are conveniences that
simplify layout.  They all evaluate down to a series of linear inequalities
which are solved by the `casuarius <https://github.enthought.com/casuarius>`_
linear constraint solver.

We can add additional constraints via inequalities directly, if we want.  For
example, if we would like to make sure that the progress bar is at least 500
pixels wide, we could add that an inequality to the constraints::

    constraints = [
        vbox(progress,
            hbox(spacer, label, spacer), 
            hbox(spacer, work_button, spacer),
            spacer),
        align('h_center', progress, label, work_button),
        progress.width >= 500,
    ]

For constraints like this which involve only one component, it is sometimes
clearer to add them to the constraints attribute of the widget itself::

    ProgressBar:
        id: progress
        constraints = [width >= 500,]
        value := model.units_done
        maximum := model.work_units

Linear equalities and inequalities are also permitted in the set of constraints,
so we could insist that the progress bar be at least twice the width of the
label::

    constraints = [
        vbox(progress,
            hbox(spacer, label, spacer), 
            hbox(spacer, work_button, spacer),
            spacer),
        align('h_center', progress, label, work_button),
        progress.width >= 2*label.width,
    ]

Most widgets in |Enaml| inherit the standard box model.  They have constraint
variables ``width``, ``height``, ``top``, ``bottom``, ``left``, ``right``,
``h_center`` and ``v_center`` that can be used in constraints.  In addition,
Container widgets have constraint variables representing the padding and
contents region: ``padding_top``, ``padding_bottom``, ``padding_left``, and
``padding_right``, as well as ``contents_width``, ``contents_height``,
``contents_top``, ``contents_bottom``, ``contents_left``, ``contents_right``,
``contents_h_center`` and ``contents_v_center``.
