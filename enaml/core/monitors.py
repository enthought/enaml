    An expression Monitor is responsible for generating bytecode which
    will be inserted into a Python expression and which inspects the
    Python stack during the evaluation to determine if it is appropriate
    to attach some form of notifier to the constiuents. If a notifier is
    warranted, it should make the appropriate connections to emit the
    expression_changed signal when the expression has changed.
