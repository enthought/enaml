# As mentioned in the notes of the docstring for WXScrollArea, we
# don't support the 'always_on' policy of the scrollbars. Since
# we only have to support 'off' or 'auto' it's easiest to use this
# mapping to convert straight from policy values into a respective
# scroll rate. A rate of Zero causes wx not to show the scroll bar.
# A positive rate indicates to scroll that many pixels per event.
# We set the rate to 1 to have smooth scrolling. Wx doesn't make a
# distinction between scroll events caused by the mouse or scrollbar
# and those caused by clicking the scroll buttons (ala qt), and thus
# this rate applies the same to all of those events. Since we expect
# that clicking on a scroll button happens much more infrequently 
# than scrolling by dragging the scroll bar, we opt for a lower rate
# in order to get smooth drag scrolling and sacrifice some usability
# on the scroll buttons.
